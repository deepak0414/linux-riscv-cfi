/*
 * Major architectures (x86, aarch64, riscv) have shadow stack now. x86 and
 * arm64 choose to use VM_SHADOW_STACK (which actually is VM_HIGH_ARCH_5) vma
 * flag, however that restrict it to 64bit implementation only. risc-v shadow
 * stack encodings in page tables is PTE.R=0, PTE.W=1, PTE.D=1 which used to be
 * reserved until now. risc-v is choosing to encode presence of only VM_WRITE in
 * vma flags as shadow stack vma. However this means that existing users of mmap
 * (and do_mmap) who were relying on passing only PROT_WRITE (or VM_WRITE from
 * kernel driver) but still getting read and write mappings, should still work.
 * x86 and arm64 followed the direction of a new system call `map_shadow_stack`.
 * risc-v would like to converge on that so that shadow stacks flows are as much
 * arch agnostic. Thus a conscious decision to define PROT_XXX definition for
 * shadow stack here (and not exposed to uapi)
